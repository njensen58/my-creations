A Digital clock with different themes to choose from.  The goal was to make a clock that could have it's classes interchanged depending on the theme selected, but the challenge I wanted to figure out was how to develop a function or two that could do this dynamically with string literals.  I achieved this with how I named my CSS theme classes, and saving the current class in a prevTheme variable.
