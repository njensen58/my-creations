The Study folder was me going into Jennifer Dewalt's code on jenniferDewalt.com.  After making a plain js version of what she did,
I then created my own iteration from memory as practice, and the link above is to mine.  The my-iteration folder has all my code, while
the study folder is a mix of mine and the example from her site.
